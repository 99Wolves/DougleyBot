{"name":"DougleyBot","tagline":"One of the many discord.js bots, but arguably one of the better ones!","body":"### DougleyBot, the Discord bot made for communities of all categories.\r\n**Meet DougleyBot, a Discord bot created for fun and silliness.**\r\n\r\nCurrently used in more than 20 different Discord servers, approximately 100 users are already using the ready-to-use version of the bot to make their chats a bit more ~~chaotic~~ fun!\r\n\r\nMaking use of the excellent [Discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/) library made by the awesome @hydrabolt, the bot is able to handle a sustantial ammount of users, and a lot of simultanious commands.\r\n\r\n### Free to use, distribute, and alter.\r\nDougleyBot is created with the GNU license with the source code located at GitHub, making it completely open-source.\r\n\r\nIf you aren't sure about redistributing, see this paragraph as a super official permission slip to distribute and alter the code as much as you see fit, it's open-source, so go nuts!\r\n\r\n### Ready-to-use, no installation needed.\r\nDougleyBot also hosts a server on which the ready-to-use version is located.\r\n\r\nBecause a already live version is present, users don't have to worry about hosting their own server, dealing with downtime, crashes and other annoyances! \r\n\r\nAnd it's completely free to use the live version, no removed commands, paywalls, donation requests, DLC or any other stupid thing that will make it annoying to have the bot in a server!\r\n\r\nInterested? [Join the test server!](https://discord.gg/0cFoiR5QVh57Spqg)\r\n\r\n### Active development and support.\r\nThe devs of DougleyBot are always trying to improve the code, make new functions and other fun stuff!\r\n\r\nBy the way, because we're open-source, you can make a request to improve our code via GitHub with a pull request, ~~we will gladly make you do our work!~~ we can always use help!\r\n\r\nHave a question? Send us a message through the test server, and we will help you to the best of our abilities!\r\n\r\n### The people that made this all possible.\r\nThe devs would like to thank @chalda, @Einarin and @Devlix for creating the [base code](https://github.com/chalda/DiscordBot), without you guys this project wouldn't exist!\r\n\r\nKudo's to @hydrabolt for creating the awesome [Discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/) library, and assisting us with questions we had about the library, you're awesome!\r\n\r\nAnd finally, @SteamingMutt, the main dev, would like to thank @Mirrorbreak for contributing a lot to the code, without you this would all be a buggy mess!","google":"UA-40716005-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
