<p><strong>Meet DougleyBot, a Discord bot created for fun and silliness.</strong></p>

<p>Currently used in more than 20 different Discord servers, approximately 100 users are already using the ready-to-use version of the bot to make their chats a bit more <del>chaotic</del> fun!</p>

<p>Making use of the excellent <a href="https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/">Discord.js</a> library made by the awesome <a href="https://github.com/hydrabolt" class="user-mention">@hydrabolt</a>, the bot is able to handle a sustantial ammount of users, and a lot of simultanious commands.</p>

<h3>
<a id="free-to-use-distribute-and-alter" class="anchor" href="#free-to-use-distribute-and-alter" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Free to use, distribute, and alter.</h3>

<p>DougleyBot is created with the GNU license with the source code located at GitHub, making it completely open-source.</p>

<p>If you aren't sure about redistributing, see this paragraph as a super official permission slip to distribute and alter the code as much as you see fit, it's open-source, so go nuts!</p>

<h3>
<a id="ready-to-use-no-installation-needed" class="anchor" href="#ready-to-use-no-installation-needed" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ready-to-use, no installation needed.</h3>

<p>DougleyBot also hosts a server on which the ready-to-use version is located.</p>

<p>Because a already live version is present, users don't have to worry about hosting their own server, dealing with downtime, crashes and other annoyances! </p>

<p>And it's completely free to use the live version, no removed commands, paywalls, donation requests, DLC or any other stupid thing that will make it annoying to have the bot in a server!</p>

<p>Interested? <a href="https://discord.gg/0cFoiR5QVh57Spqg">Join the test server!</a></p>

<h3>
<a id="active-development-and-support" class="anchor" href="#active-development-and-support" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Active development and support.</h3>
