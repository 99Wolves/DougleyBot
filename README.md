# DougleyBot
A chat bot for discord app based off <a href="https://github.com/chalda/DiscordBot/">Chalda's DiscordBot</a>, which is based off <a href="https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/">discord.js</a>.

# Notice
If you plan on just using DougleyBot as a chatbot, and don't plan on using the files, you can make DougleyBot join your server via DougleyBot's Test server (https://discord.gg/0cFoiR5QVh57Spqg). Use `!join-server <instant-invite>` to make DougleyBot join your server.
**Note** that `!pullanddeploy`, `!online` and `!idle` don't work on this instance.

## Todo

- [x] Make it that bot runs without some of the code from the original DiscordBot.
- [ ] Clean up the code a bit.
- [ ] Make it so that !help takes arguments, so it can explain functions independently
- [ ] Add permissions to certain commands. (Like !pullanddeploy, !online, !idle)
- [x] Add more memes and abbriviations for the !meme and !game commands.
    - [ ] Create a function that will pull the popular memes from Imgflip, and integrate them automaticly.
- [ ] Integrate !memehelp into !help.
- [ ] Integrate a WolframAlpha command. The original DiscordBot had one, but that didn't work.
- [ ] Make it so that log files are written when !log is used, instead of printing them to the console.
